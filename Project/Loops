Question :- Why do we have do_while loop when while and for loop is available?

Answer:- do-while loop is a useful tool when you want to ensure that a loop body is executed at least once,
even if the loop condition is initially false. While the for loop is used for a definite number of iterations 
and the while and do-while loops are used for an indefinite number of iterations.
