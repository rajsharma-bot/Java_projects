Question :- Why do we have do_while loop when while and for loop is available?

Answer:- do-while loop is a useful tool when you want to ensure that a loop body is executed at least once,
even if the loop condition is initially false. While the for loop is used for a definite number of iterations 
and the while and do-while loops are used for an indefinite number of iterations.

Question:- write difference between while, do.while and for loop?
Answer:- There are  main difference
For Loop:- for loop is used when we know how many times loop is need to be executed 
Syntax:-for(initialization; condition;updating){
statement
}

While:-  while loop is used to repeatedly execute a block of code while a specified condition is true.
loops is used when we don't know how many times loop need to be executed.
Syntax:-While(condition){
Statement}

do while loop:- Do while loop is similar to while loop but in do while loop code will be executed atleast once even if
condition fails
Syntax:-
do{Statement
}
While(condition)
